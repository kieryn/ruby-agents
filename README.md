# Agentic

Agentic is a lightweight Ruby framework for building *agentic* applicationsâ€”systems composed of autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and act.

This repository is a work-in-progress. The initial release provides the gem skeleton, tests, and a minimal example. Future updates will flesh out the core abstractions.

## Requirements

* Ruby **3.1.0** or newer (tested up to 3.3.x)

## Installation

```
$ gem install agentic
```

Or add this line to your **Gemfile**:

```ruby
gem "agentic"
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "agentic"

puts Agentic.hello #=> "Hello, world! I am an agent."
```

More elaborate examples can be found in the `examples/` directory.

## Development

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake spec
```
